# Seacap Funding Application Portal — Backend

## Overview

This backend powers the Seacap funding application portal.

It receives application data from the frontend, stores it in MongoDB, generates a PDF funding application document, and emails the PDF to the company.

The backend also exposes API endpoints to retrieve submitted applications.

# Core Features

## Application Submission

Applications are submitted through:

```
POST /api/application
```

The backend performs the following steps:

1. Validate request body
2. Generate application number
3. Save application to MongoDB
4. Generate funding application PDF
5. Send PDF via email
6. Return API response

Example response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "applicationId": "69aa2c203a1f7843ac771906",
  "applicationNumber": "SEA-2026-00028"
}
```

---

# Application Number System

Each submission generates a human-readable number.

Example:

```
SEA-2026-00001
SEA-2026-00002
SEA-2026-00003
```

Format:

```
SEA-{YEAR}-{SEQUENCE}
```

This makes applications easier to reference compared to MongoDB IDs.

---

# Conditional Partner Logic

The partner section appears only when ownership is below 51%.

Rule:

```
Ownership < 51 → Partner Information Required
Ownership ≥ 51 → Partner Section Hidden
```

This logic is enforced in the PDF generation.

---

# PDF Generation

PDF applications are generated using Puppeteer.

The PDF includes:

* Business Information
* Owner Information
* Partner Information (conditional)
* Terms and Signature

Security considerations:

* Email and phone numbers are **not included in the PDF**
* Only the **last 4 digits of SSN** are displayed

---

# Email Automation

Once the PDF is generated, the system sends an email with the PDF attached.

Development mode uses **Ethereal email preview links**.

Example attachment:

```
Seacap_Funding_Application_SEA-2026-00028.pdf
```
